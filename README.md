# EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

## It is a crucial step in the data analysis process
### Understanding the Data: 
    EDA helps in comprehending the dataset's characteristics, including its variables, distributions, and any missing values.

### Data Cleaning: 
    EDA involves tasks like handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers to ensure data quality.

### Identifying Patterns and Relationships: 
    EDA uses visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

### Formulating Hypotheses: 
    EDA generates hypotheses about the data, which can be further tested using statistical methods or machine learning algorithms.

### Feature Engineering: 
    EDA informs feature selection and engineering decisions to create meaningful predictors for modeling.

### Model Selection and Validation: 
    EDA assists in selecting appropriate models by understanding the data distribution and model assumptions.

### Communication: 
    EDA communicates insights to stakeholders through interpretable visualizations and summaries.

### Iterative Process: 
    EDA is iterative, allowing for continuous refinement of analysis techniques based on new insights.

### Domain Knowledge Integration: 
    EDA benefits from incorporating domain knowledge to interpret findings in context.

### Exploratory Nature: 
    EDA is flexible and does not have fixed rules, allowing analysts to choose techniques based on the dataset and analysis goals.
### It involves Process such as:-
### 1) Analysis
    Univariate Analysis
    Multivariate Analysis
   
### 3) Feature Engineering
    Creating New Columns
    Modifying Existing Ones
    
### 4) Handling Outliers
    Detect Outliers
    Remove Outliers
    
### The Entire process is Highly Iterative
